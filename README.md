# Blinkit-Analysis-Excel-Dashboard

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing real-time Blinkit data using Excel. It covers the full workflow including data cleaning, transformation, exploration, and interactive dashboard creation. The goal is to convert raw operational data into meaningful insights that support business decision-making.

**Key Features**

• Complete end-to-end Excel project
• Data cleaning and formatting for analysis
• Use of formulas, pivot tables, and slicers
• KPI tracking for orders, revenue, and delivery performance
• Interactive Excel dashboard with user-friendly visuals
• Clear representation of trends and category performance

**Problem Statement**

Blinkit deals with high volumes of daily order and delivery data. The main challenge is turning raw, unorganized data into actionable insights. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to identify customer demand patterns, operational bottlenecks, and business performance trends.

**Solution**

Using Excel, I structured and cleaned the dataset, applied essential functions, and built pivot tables to extract insights. An interactive dashboard was then designed to track key metrics such as order volume, top categories, revenue trends, and delivery efficiency. This solution transforms raw data into easy-to-understand insights that help stakeholders make informed business decisions.
